## Progression/Levels/Hordes

- As the waves pass and the difficulty of the enemies, the experience needed to level up increases and the experience gained also increases disproportionately;
- Over time, stronger enemies appear, larger numbers of enemies and possible bosses;
- As the character levels up, the game presents a list of possible items for the player to choose from. (Add skip, reroll, banish option);

## AI/Enemy movement

- Enemies spawn outside the player's screen from all sides (except the “protection” point);
- Enemies always move towards the player;
