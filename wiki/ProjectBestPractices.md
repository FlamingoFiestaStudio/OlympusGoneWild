# Project Best Practices

This page will guide you through setting up the project, provide information on branch naming conventions, Godot version compatibility, and an overview of the directory structure. Additionally, we use priority labels to help organize and prioritize tasks. For more conventional best practices please reade this:

- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/index.html
- https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/index.html

## Code Styles

- Use `get_node` instead of `$` to get a node from the tree, for example, `@onready var my_node = get_node("MyNode")`, (based: https://github.com/FlamingoFiestaStudio/OlympusGoneWild/pull/26#discussion_r1328143299);
- Variables names should be in snake_case, example: `var my_variable_name: int = 42`;
- Try to implicit all types, for example: `var my_string: string = "My String"`;

## Branch Naming Convention

The branch should have the number of the issue and the title of the issue separated by `-`, for example: `{number of the ticket}-name-of-the-ticket` or `123-my-issue-title`.

To simplify, you could just click here on the issue page, and this will do the magic for you:

## Commit Message Convections

Consistently using this convention ensures clear and structured commit messages, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose of each commit.

`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

- `<type>`: Describes the purpose or category of the commit;
- `[optional scope]` (optional): Specifies the scope or affected component of the commit or issue number;
- `<description>`: Provides a brief, concise summary of the changes introduced in the commit;

### Commit Types

Choose an appropriate <type> from the following list:

- `feat`: A new feature or enhancement;
- `fix`: A bug fix or correction;
- `docs`: Documentation changes or updates;
- `style`: Code style and formatting improvements (no functional changes);
- `refactor`: Code refactoring, restructuring, or optimizations;
- `chore`: Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes;

### Commit Description

The <description> should be a concise summary of the changes introduced in the commit. Be clear and informative but keep it brief.

### Example Commit Messages

Here are some examples of correctly formatted commit messages:

- `feat(#123): Add a new player bullet.`
- `fix(player): Fix player movimentation issue.`
- `docs(readme): Update installation instructions.`
- `style(main menu): Adjust formatting for consistency.`
- `refactor: Optimize enemy code.`
- `chore: Update dependencies to latest versions.`

## Pull Requests

On creating a pull request, we have a [basic pull request template with some sections](https://github.com/FlamingoFiestaStudio/OlympusGoneWild/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), try to fill all of them.

If you don't have nothing to add in the description of some section, please leave as: `N/A.` (Not Applicable).

### Comments Resolution and revisions

When you submit a PR, someone will review your code:

- If that person approves your changes, you did a nice work;
- If that person leaves some comments:
    - If you agree, change what the reviewers said, and notify the person after push;
    - If you do not agree, be nice and explain why do you not think in the same way;
    - The comments should be only closed by the person who left the comment;

## Priority Labels

We use the following priority labels to help organize and prioritize tasks:

- **P1 (Highest Priority)**: Critical tasks or issues that require immediate attention.
- **P2**: High-priority tasks that need to be addressed soon.
- **P3**: Medium-priority tasks that can be scheduled based on the project's needs.
- **P4**: Low-priority tasks or nice-to-have features that can be worked on when time allows.
