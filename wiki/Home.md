# Olympus Gone Wild

https://github.com/FlamingoFiestaStudio/OlympusGoneWild

## Summary

Olympus Gone Wild is an open source game based on games like Vampire Survivors, and is therefore a “2D top-down shooter” in which the player faces successive hordes of enemies that increase in difficulty over time. In order to follow this dynamic system, the game features a continuous progression system through which the player evolves proportionally to the difficulty of the basic enemies.

This project arises from the team's desire to develop a complete project in order to acquire and solidify knowledge in the area of game/software development and teamwork.
