# History

After several years of exile in the world of the dead, Hades aspired to settle in Olympus, so he paid Morpheus to cause Zeus to dream about the death of his son, Heracles, as blackmail. Understanding the origin of these dreams Zeus banishes Hades forever in the underworld and from contact with the other gods of Olympus. As a last desperate attempt, Hades threatens to condemn Heracles and Perseus to eternal suffering after their deaths. To put an end to the story, Zeus kidnaps his daughter Persephone. With nothing to lose now, Hades launches an attack on Olympus, and all hell breaks loose. Busy fighting Hades, Zeus assigns his most capable son, Apollo, to guard the gates of Olympus and keep the dead out. This is the story of Apollo's mythical battle on a wild Olympus.
