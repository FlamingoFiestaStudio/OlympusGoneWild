Welcome to the repository for our Godot 4 game project! This README will guide you through setting up the project, provide information on branch naming conventions, Godot version compatibility, and an overview of the directory structure. Additionally, we use priority labels to help organize and prioritize tasks.

## Setting Up the Project

To manage the Godot version for this project, we recommend using the [Godot Version Manager](https://github.com/noidexe/godot-version-manager/releases/download/v1.13/Godot.Version.Manager.v1.13-win.zip) or check their repository for further questions [Repository Link](https://github.com/noidexe/godot-version-manager/releases/tag/v1.13). Download and install this manager to easily control the Godot version used for development.

1. Download and install the Godot Version Manager from the provided link.
2. Initialize a new project using Godot 4.0.4 stable.
3. Clone this repository into your project directory.

## Branch Naming Convention

Please follow this branch naming convention when creating branches for new features, bug fixes, or tasks:

`{number of the ticket}-name-of-the-ticket`

For example, if you are working on ticket number 42, the branch name should be:

`42-implement-player-movement`

## Priority Labels

We use the following priority labels to help organize and prioritize tasks:

- **P1 (Highest Priority)**: Critical tasks or issues that require immediate attention.
- **P2**: High-priority tasks that need to be addressed soon.
- **P3**: Medium-priority tasks that can be scheduled based on the project's needs.
- **P4**: Low-priority tasks or nice-to-have features that can be worked on when time allows.

## Godot Version

This project is compatible with Godot 4.0.4 stable. Make sure you have set up the correct Godot version using the Godot Version Manager as mentioned above.
